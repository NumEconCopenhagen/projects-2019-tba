# # Solow model with climate change 
#%% [markdown]
# Consider the standard Solow-model with an indicator for climate change where:
# 
# $K_t$ is capital
#     $L_t$ is labor (growing with a constant rate of $n$)
#     $A_t$ is technology (growing with a constant rate of $g$)
#     $D_t$ is the damage function (growing with a constant rate of $n$)
#     $Y_t = F(K_t,A_t,L_t,D_t)$ is GDP
# 
#     
# The Damage-function depends on temperature T
# 
# $$ D_t = 1-\frac{1}{1+\theta_1T_t^{\theta_2}} =< 1 $$
# 
# $T_t^{\theta_2}$ is the global mean temperature change at time t. $\theta_1$ is the damage parameter.
#     
# Cobb-Douglas production-function
# 
# 
# $$ F(K_{t},A_{t}L_{t},D_{t})=  (1-D_{t})A_{t}K_{t}^{\alpha}L_{t}^{1-\alpha}$$
# 
# It is convenient to express all variables of interest in terms of per effective worker, as this can we used as a measure of welfare of sociely. We use small letters to denote per effective worker, so $y=Y/AL$ and $k=K/AL $, which gives: 
# 
# $$ f({k}_{t})=(1-D){k}_{t}^{\alpha} $$
# 
# 
# Saving is a constant fraction of GDP
# 
# $$ S_t = sY_t,\,s\in(0,1) $$
# 
# 
#  **Capital accumulates** according to
# 
# \\[ K_{t+1}=S_{t}+(1-\delta)K_{t}=sF(K_{t},A_{t}L_{t})+(1-\delta)K_{t}, \delta \in (0,1) \\]
# 
# The economy is growing over time (due to exogenous technological progress and population growth), which makes it useful to focus on the behavior of capital stock per unit of effective labor. The transition in the model can be decribed by
# 
# 
# \\[ \tilde{k}_{t+1}= \frac{1}{(1+n)(1+g)}[sf(\tilde{k}_{t})+(1-\delta)\tilde{k}_{t}] \\]

#%% [markdown]
# It becomes clear that the steady state capital excluding the damage function (representing climate change) is higher than the steady state capital in case of climate damage. Climate change is a negative externality for the society. For example, increased temperature causes sea level to rise and drought periods. This again, can increase human conflicts. Today's generation benefits from the use of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and in turn causes climate change. But the benefit from using fossil fuels, does not internalize these external costs of climate change.

# # Impact of damage on steady state capital

def calc_ss(D):
    return ss_func(0.2,0.02,0.01,0.1,1/3, D)

#%% [markdown]
# Create a while loop so that a new list (nDs)is generated that contains all steady states for the respective D.
# 

#%%

while index <= len(Ds)-1:
    Ds[index] = calc_ss(Ds[index])
    index = index +1

print(Ds)


#%%
Damage = [0,0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]

#%% [markdown]
# ## Plot: 

#%%
fid, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(Damage, Ds)
ax.set(xlabel = 'Damage', ylabel ='Steady state')
plt.show()

#%% [markdown]
# From the plot we can see that as damage increases, the steady state capital decreases. This could be due to higher expenses in order to compensate for i.e. agricultural damage.
