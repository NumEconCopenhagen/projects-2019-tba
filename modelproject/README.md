# Modelproject

In our model project we anaylse the Solow Model and extend it with the impact of climate change.
The source for this model orginiates from:
Elisabeth Moyer, Mark D. Woolley, Michael J. Glotter & David A. Weisbach, "Climate Impacts on Economic Growth as Drivers of Uncertainty in the Social Cost of Carbon" (Coase-Sandor Institute for Law & Economics Working Paper No. 652, 2013).

The notebook is organized as follows:

1. Solving and simulating the model
    with and without the climate component
2. Visualizations on steady state capital


In addition to this README-file, the repository contains a jupyter notebook which presents all the results and python model named ModelProject which contains the code. 


Running the notebook requires:
pip install panda
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
pip install ipywidgets
pip install scipy
pip install sympy
