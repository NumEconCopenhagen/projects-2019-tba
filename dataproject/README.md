# Dataproject

In our data project, we use data directly imported from the World Data Bank. We have chosen to focus on 9 different countries: China, Japan, Brazil, U.S., Denmark, Spain, Turkmenistan, India, Nigeria. These countries are chosen because they are relatively different, which makes the analysis interesting. The variables of interest are: GDP per capita, GDP (current US $), Population total, Urban Population in %, Fertility rate and Literacy rate.

The notebook is organized as follows

1. Data Cleaning and Structuring
2. Data Analysis and visualisations
    - Interactive GDP per capital plot
    - World map displaying GDP per capita
    - Data visualization on fertility rate
3. Regression ?


In addition to this README-file, the repository contains a jupyter notebook which presents all the results and python model named dataproject which contains the code. 


Running the notebook requires:
pip install pandas-datareader
pip install wbdata
pip install folium
pip install matplotlib 
pip install ipywidgets
